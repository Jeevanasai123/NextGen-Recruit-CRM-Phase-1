# NextGen-Recruit-CRM-Phase-1
Recruitment processes in many organizations are fragmented, involving scattered job postings, manual resume screening, and inconsistent communication with applicants. This results in inefficiency, delayed hiring decisions, and poor candidate experiences.

The NextGen Recruit CRM is a Salesforce-based recruitment platform designed to streamline job postings, manage applications, track candidate progress, and facilitate smooth communication between recruiters, hiring managers, and applicants. The system aims to reduce hiring delays, improve transparency, and provide actionable insights for HR teams.
